The game Nomic played as part of the CUNY Graduate Center course on Programming and Hacking Communities. In addition to following Roberts Rules in class-room sessions, the development of the Nomic game is also tracked with GitHub pull requests for each motion.

For more information on the course, see the CUNY Graduate Center website and the Computer Science program.

We start out with a very slightly modified version of the [initial rule set](http://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/nomic.htm#initial%20set) by Peter Suber.
